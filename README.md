# makeMocloAssy
This program is intended to assist with creating picklists for labcyte echo based on intended golden gate or gibson assembly reactions. All interactions are based on a known "parts list" file which represents a set of real microtiter plates that contain actual DNA files. Sequences of all DNA files are recorded in these documents and simulated golden gate or gibson assembly reactions are carried out to assist with molecular cloning.
